DeMethify is a suite of methylation deconvolution algorithms that mainly revolves around adapted non-negative matrix factorization, offering a versatile toolbox for heterogeneous methylation data.

Plenty of different uses cases:

Can estimate methylation profiles, cell types proportions, with confidence intervals:
