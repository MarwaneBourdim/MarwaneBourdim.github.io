Hi ! My name is Marwane Bourdim. 

I am a recent math graduate from Université Paris-Cité and Sorbonne Université and **I am currently on the job market looking for for data scientist and quantitative analyst positions**. **I am also interested in phd projects in machine learning and mathematics**, especially applied to biology, personalised medecine,
nlp and interspecies communication (a soft spot of mine is the [CETI project](https://www.projectceti.org/))!
My goal is to use math and computer science for the greater good, learn more about the world, and have fun doing it :)

Apart from math, I'm passionate about philosophy, drawing and teaching.
