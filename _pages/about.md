Hi ! My name is Marwane Bourdim. 

I am a recent math graduate from Université Paris-Cité and Sorbonne Université and I am currently on the job market for data scientist and quantitative analyst positions. I am also interested in phd projects in machine Learning and mathematics, especially applied to biology, personalised medecine,
linguistics and interspecies communication (a soft spot of mine is the [CETI project](https://www.projectceti.org/))!
My goal is to use math and computer science for the greater good, learn more about ourselves and have fun :)

Apart from math, I'm passionate about philosophy, drawing and teaching.

Education
======
* **Master's degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Machine Learning**  
*Université Paris-Cité, France | 2021-2022*
* **Master's degree in Mathematical Modeling (Biology and stochastic modeling track)**  
*Sorbonne Université, France | 2020-2021*
* **Bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics**  
*Université de Paris-Cité, France | 2018-2019*

Work experience
======
* **Mathematics Teacher for middle schoolers and high schoolers**  
*[École alsacienne](https://www.ecole-alsacienne.org/), Paris, France \| February 2023 - June 2023*
  * I had four classes to teach, two 4èmes (~ Year 8) and two 2ndes (~ Year 10). This gave me the opportunity to improve my communication skills (especially public speaking) through a very rewarding experience.  
* **Research intern**  
*Supervised by Isidro Cortés-Ciriano, at [Cancer Genomics Lab](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/cortes-ciriano/), EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, United Kingdom \| February 2022 - January 2023*
  * Developed two new SOTA methylation deconvolution algorithms by using supervised and unsupervised methods and implemented them in Python in a self-contained Command-Line Interface software. 
* **Research intern**  
*Supervised by Dirk Drasdo and Jules Dichamp, ar [SIMBIOTX lab](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/), INRIA Paris-Saclay, Paris, France \| April 2021 - September 2021*
  * Developed a variety of SIR compartment stochastic models and used the Gillespie algorithm for the simulations (implemented in Python).
