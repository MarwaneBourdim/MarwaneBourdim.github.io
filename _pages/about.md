Hi! My name is Marwane Bourdim.  

I’m a Data Scientist at the [Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/about-our-research/data-science-at-the-icr). I work with researchers to build machine learning tools that make sense of different kinds of cancer data. My goal is to help make biology more predictive and engineerable, especially in personalised medicine and longevity research.  

Outside of work, I’m into philosophy and social justice. I believe maths and science should serve people.

Work and Academic Experience  
======  

- **Data Scientist**  
  *[Institute of Cancer Research (ICR)](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/about-our-research/data-science-at-the-icr), London, United Kingdom | March 2024 – Present*  
  - As part of the Data Science Team, I collaborate with research groups across the institute to provide data analysis expertise and co-develop research projects. This role involves designing and implementing machine learning tools for analysing diverse omics data and integrating multi-modal datasets   

- **Mathematics Teacher for Middle Schoolers and High Schoolers**  
  *[École Alsacienne](https://www.ecole-alsacienne.org/), Paris, France | February 2023 – August 2023*  
  - Taught mathematics to year 4èmes and 2ndes (ages 13-15) at a prestigious private school. Participated in several outreach initiatives to make mathematics more accessible and engaging for younger audiences.

- **Research Intern**  
  *Supervised by Isidro Cortés-Ciriano, [Cancer Genomics Lab](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/cortes-ciriano/), EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, United Kingdom | February 2022 – January 2023*  
  - Designed and implemented a suite of methylation deconvolution algorithms to elucidate the tumour microenvironment and denoise methylation data for potential clinical applications, including methylation-based tumour classification. 

- **Research Intern**  
  *Supervised by Dirk Drasdo and Jules Dichamp, [SIMBIOTX Lab](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/), INRIA Paris-Saclay, Paris, France | April 2021 – September 2021*  
  - Designed and implemented a simulation of a spatio-temporal stochastic model of COVID-19 spread in France.
