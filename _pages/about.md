Welcome! I am currently a MSc student of Mathematics and Machine Learning at the Université de Paris. 

I'm interested in stochastic processes, scientific computing and more generally in the application of mathematical and computational tools to systems biology and synthetic biology. I also have a keen interest for autonomous learning and AI. 

I'm currently looking for an internship, if you think I'll be a good fit don't hesitate to contact me at firstname.lastname@etu.u-paris.fr or through LinkedIn/Twitter!
