Welcome! I am currently a MSc student of Mathematics and Machine Learning at the Université de Paris. 

I'm globally interested in the applications of mathematical and computational tools to biology. I love bold new ideas like the use of Optimal Transport to fill in the gap of single-cell sequencing data ([Schiebinger and al.](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(19)30039-X.pdf)), or random matrix theory to denoise it ([Aparicio and al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920300404#!)). 

One of my main interests is Machine Learning especially applied to drug discovery/drug repurposing, protein design and genomics. I am particularly attracted by Geometric Deep Learning ([Bronstein and al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478)) and heuristics that take advantage of the symmetries of the data to be able to produce efficient neural network models. 

I am also very enthusiastic about the attempts to mathematize biology that can be found in Rashevsky, Rosen or Baez. 

I am glad to announce that I am going to be an intern at EMBL-EBI in the [Cortes-Ciriano group](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research-beta/cortes-ciriano/) to work on AI applied to Cancer Genomics thanks to the EMBL-EBI French Embassy fellowship ! 

Education
======

*Université Paris-Cité, France | 2021-2022*
**Master's degree in Mathematical Modeling (Biology and stochastic modeling track)**
*Sorbonne Université, France | 2020-2021*
**Bachelor's degree in Pure Mathematics**  
*Université de Paris-Cité, France | 2018-2019*

Work experience
======
* **Mathematics Teacher for middle schoolers and high schoolers**
  * *[École alsacienne]([https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/](https://www.ecole-alsacienne.org/)), Paris, France | February 2023 - June 2023*
  * I had four classes to teach, two 4èmes (~ Year 8) and two 2ndes (~ Year 10). This gave me the opportunity to improve my communication skills (especially public speaking) through a very rewarding experience.  
* **Research intern**
  * *Supervised by Isidro Cortés-Ciriano, at [Cancer Genomics Lab](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/), EMBL-EBI, Cambridge, United Kingdom | February 2022 - January 2023*
  * Developed two new SOTA methylation deconvolution algorithms by using supervised and unsupervised methods and implemented them in Python in a self-contained Command-Line Interface software. 
* **Research intern**
  * *Supervised by Dirk Drasdo and Jules Dichamp, ar [SIMBIOTX lab](https://team.inria.fr/simbiotx/), INRIA Paris-Saclay, Paris, France | April 2021 - September 2021*
  * Developed a variety of SIR compartment stochastic models and used the Gillespie algorithm for the simulations (implemented in Python).
